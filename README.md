# Using this starter kit is as simple as running the following command in your terminal:

# npx create-react-app your-project-name-here (NOTE: npx is not a typo! npx comes with npm version 5.2+ and higher)

# Once the project is created, we can simply navigate into the newly-created project folder and run

# npm start

# This will run the React development server and automatically open up a browser tab


# delete the project
# uninstall create-react-app
# upgrade node to 14.5 (I use nvm, nvm install 14.5, nvm use 14.5)
# try again with npx create-react-app app-name
